    "<div style=\"text-align: justify\">MRI is one of the most crucial techniques in clinical diagnosis and research. As a non-invasive, repeatable and more accurate technique, it is becoming more and more essential in nowadays medical treatment. However, MRI is difficult and costly. Statistics show that the average price of MR imaging in the UK is 788 (US Dollar) [1] in 2015. On one hand, the study objects need to lie still and hold breath during the image acquisition in order not to degrade the quality of the images. On the other hand, the long image acquisition time results in the high cost per imaging which leads to MR method remain relatively unused.</div>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<div style=\"text-align: justify\">The image information acquired from MR is k-space data which is determined by the field-of-view (FOV), the spatial resolution of the image and the Nyquist criterion. Once the FOV and spatial resolution are set, the k-space information that we acquired is determined by the Nyquist criterion. A common method (Undersampled Acquisition) that is used to reduce the MR imaging acquisition time is to not collect the full number of k-space data points which is against the Nyquist criterion that expects to collect the full number of k-space data. Due to the violation of the Nyquist criterion, aliasing artefacts will be seen in the reconstructed images. Aliasing appearance depends on how the samples are taken. Methods have been implemented to reduce the aliasing artefacts, i.e. parallel imaging, compressed sensing reconstruction. The realisation of parallel imaging need multiple coils and will not be discussed in this report.</div>"

    "<div style=\"text-align: justify\">In undersampled MRI, the goal is to find a function $f$ that can map the undersampled k-space data to an image $y'$ which has high similarity with the ground truth image $y$ or to say the image gained from full-sampled k-space data. $x_{full}$ denotes the full-sampled k-space data while $x$ denotes the k-space data after undersampling. As shown in Figure 1, the undersampled MRI consists of 2 parts, undersampling and reconstruction. In the undersampling part, the undersampling strategy used in this report, as required, is the Cartesian undersampling trajectory. First, it generates random 4-fold/8-fold mask function using the trajectory. Then would receive the under-sampled k-space data $x$ by multiplying the mask function and the full-sampled k-space data $x_{full}$. $\\mathcal{F}$ represents the Fourier Transformation and $\\mathcal{F^{-1}}$ represents the inverse Fourier Transformation. </div>\n",
    "<div style=\"text-align: justify\">In Figure 2, apply a random 4-fold mask to a full-sampled k-space data and receive corresponding undersampled k-space data. If inverse Fourier Transformation is directly applied to the undersampled data ( $f = \\mathcal{F}^{-1}$), a blurred image ( $y'$ )is constructed. In order to gain less blurred image, this report focuses on building and adopting different reconstruction function. The goal </div>"
